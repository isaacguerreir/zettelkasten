# Functional Synthetic Biology

The software group of iGEM Engineering Committee is writing a document 
about a Functional Synthetic Biology, a vision that will try to make the 
design of genetic parts more easy by try to focus more on the function of
parts instead of the sequence.

Well, thinking more about it, I imagined that moving to a more functional 
view of synthetic biology is about describing what you want, instead of relying 
in implementing from zero whatever design you want.

This happens because:

## The problem
- Synthesis is expensive.
- A small change to a functional genetic sequence could be catastrophic, so 
changes are risky and should be avoided as much as possible.

## What changes are proposed
- For a well caracterized part or group of parts is necessary *specialists* on 
the specific function intention.
- *Specialists* are used here from a more broader sense, as someone with a more 
deep understanding.
- Being open about a design choice is a chance for being criticized, but also 
improve. If communities are build around a specific theme, the community specialized 
knowledge is translated in high functional usable packages.
- Documentation of functionality, design decisions, use cases, and how well
caracterized/tested is more important than the sequence itself. A sequence without
documentation is useless.
- Versioning designs allow people not only to be free to change from zero a 
specific part, but also to not worry about people using an older version of the part.
- Interfaces that allow easy access to this parts/packages. So importing functions 
will be seamless.
- Software tools for improving baseline standards to parts and packages will be important 
to ensure caracteristics the community need like: synthesizability, composability, 
orthogonality and more.

## Sequence to functional
- Having a reliable group of functional packages/parts is the first step towards moving
from sequence-view of synbio to a more functional.
- With this reliable packages is possible to assembly designs by defining their
functional aspects.
- Following Pareto's law, it's possible to say that having a small but highly used group of 
functional packages will be enough to cover the majority of designs constrains.
- With more and more reliable functional packages, more standards, more functions could
be used to define constrains for a design.
